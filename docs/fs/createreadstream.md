Returns a new [`ReadStream`][] object. (See [Readable Stream][]).

Be aware that, unlike the default value set for `highWaterMark` on a
readable stream (16 kb), the stream returned by this method has a
default value of 64 kb for the same parameter.

`options` is an object or string with the following defaults:

```js
const defaults = {
  flags: 'r',
  encoding: null,
  fd: null,
  mode: 0o666,
  autoClose: true
};
```

`options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from
the file instead of the entire file.  Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and
start counting at 0. If `fd` is specified and `start` is omitted or `undefined`,
`fs.createReadStream()` reads sequentially from the current file position.
The `encoding` can be any one of those accepted by [`Buffer`][].

If `fd` is specified, `ReadStream` will ignore the `path` argument and will use
the specified file descriptor. This means that no `'open'` event will be
emitted. Note that `fd` should be blocking; non-blocking `fd`s should be passed
to [`net.Socket`][].

If `autoClose` is false, then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if
there's an error. It is the application's responsibility to close it and make
sure there's no file descriptor leak. If `autoClose` is set to true (default
behavior), on `error` or `end` the file descriptor will be closed
automatically.

`mode` sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits), but only if the
file was created.

An example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:

```js
fs.createReadStream('sample.txt', { start: 90, end: 99 });
```

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding.
